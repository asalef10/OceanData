# DataAsset Ethereum Smart Contracts
This repository contains Ethereum smart contracts for the DataAsset project. DataAsset is a decentralized marketplace for data where users can buy and sell access to data.

# Smart Contracts
The main contracts in this project are DataAsset and DataAssetFactory.

* DataAsset: This contract represents a data asset. It includes functionality for creating a new data asset, setting the price, and transferring ownership. Each data asset is an NFT (non-fungible token), represented by a unique token ID.

* DataAssetFactory: This contract is used to deploy new instances of DataAsset. Each user who wants to sell data creates a new DataAsset through this factory contract.
